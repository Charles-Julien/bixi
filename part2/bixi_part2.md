# Instructions

• Explore linear regression models for the response variables of
interest, specifically, for trip lengths (duration) and revenue.

• Be sure that your analyses allow you to answer well formulated
business / research questions that you wish to explore through these
models. The goal is to use linear regression models to provide
interesting and relevant insights from the data.

• Comment on findings and discuss the main takeaways from these analyses
from a business perspective. Be sure to provide relevant model outputs
that support your discussion.

• Discuss any shortcomings or limitations of the analyses carried out.

# Business/Research questions

Examples :

Are revenues significantly higher during the weekend?

Does the average trip duration varies from member to non-member?
